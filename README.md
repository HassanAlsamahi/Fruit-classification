# Fruit-classification

This is a practice code to try convolutional neural networks for the first time, I've used Fruit Images Dataset from the following repository 
<br /> https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset.git 

<br /> You can find the paper here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321475443_Fruit_recognition_from_images_using_deep_learning

# Results
I have used python and pytorch to train this dataset to classify fruits from images, and it shows 97% accuracy.
